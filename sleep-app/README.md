### Bedtime Story

Users can give description of what type of story they want to hear and read the generated story with images or have the app read their bedtime story for them to relax before falling asleep. 

### AI Calling

Users can set an alarm on when they want to wake up and an AI character will call them at the specified time and talk with them while they try to wake up.
